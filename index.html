          <blockquote>
            "The best TA I have ever had. He is amazing, went above and beyond, and made sure that every
student understood the course material and how to approach every single problem. I did so well
on the first midterm largely because of him. The difference in scores (projection) of the two
midterms is the difference in the TA sections. This guy deserves all the money in the world to
just keep teaching and working with students. I do not give praise lightly, and I was beyond
blown away by this amazing TA. It was an honor to be in his class." <i>Econ 100A, 2025.</i>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "My friend who was not enrolled in the course would attend their discussion sections with me
because she really enjoyed their teaching style." <i>Econ 100A, 2025.</i>
          </blockquote>
           <blockquote>
            "This TA did an amazing job in leading lessons with thoughtful examples and colorful descriptions
of the lessons covered in class. I really feel like I learned some of the concepts covered in class
in this TA's TA sessions. The TA works with the students so that everyone fully understands the
topic at hand."<i>GPCO 401, 2024. </i>
          </blockquote>
           <blockquote>
            "I actually really enjoyed this course more than I thought I would. The teacher made the learning
environment very welcoming. He never just spoke at you for 2.5 hours. He engaged with you by
asking questions, telling jokes, relating the material to practical scenarios, etc. If professor
Munoz was to teach Econ 100C or some other Econ course, I would definitely consider taking it
in the Fall."  <i>Econ 100B, 2024 (As instructor).</i>
